=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyClass;
    use Moose;
    use MooseX::SomeExtension;

    ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<MooseX::*> namespace is for I<Moose extensions>, not a general space for
any module that happens to use L<Moose>.

Usually, such modules will make use of L<Moose::Exporter> to make their
extension available to the calling class. It may define a class or attribute
trait, apply a role, or perhaps provide sugar functions.

Things that do B<not> belong in the C<MooseX::*> namespace are: classes that
use Moose for their OO, and packages that use L<Moose::Role> to provide
implementation. Instead, name those modules for what they I<do> not how they
do it.

(This documentation is a preliminary placeholder for more information. Patches
welcome!)
